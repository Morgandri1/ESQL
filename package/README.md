# ESQL

ESQL is a way to easily make simple datebases for your discord bot so you don't have to use JSON. 

### how does it work? 

Its pretty simple. you create a datebase, then feed in the variables you want to have.

the tool automatically generates a README specific to how to implement your DB system.


### What's going on under the hood?

We populate a file using your given variables, then when you finish up, your file is created in your CWD.
