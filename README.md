# ESQL

ESQL is a way to easily make simple datebases for your discord bot so you don't have to use JSON. 

### how does it work? 

Its pretty simple. Navigate to your project directory, then you create a datebase, then feed in the variables you want to have.


### What's going on under the hood?

We populate a file using your given variables, then when you finish up, your file is created in your CWD.

#### creating a DB

windows:
```ESQL -c```

*NIX systems:
```python3 -m ESQL -c```
